*Public transportation? In my park?*

If your park is big enough, visitors might walk all the way to a ride that they like, have a go, and then say "well, I'm tired, better go home". You can get a taste of this early on in Victoria Lake if you choose to build something at the other side of the lake.

Transport rides help with this - visitors can take a transport ride to get where they want to be, or just to get _somewhere_ if they are wandering around.

## Boat transport
With how slow these things are moving, they really could use an on-board cafeteria - should you use these for more than a short scenic ride, the guests will be starving by the time they get out.

## Elevator
Moves guests up and down! There are about two spots across the entire campaign where elevator is legitimately useful.

## Miniature railway
Not fast, but pretty cute.

## Monorails
These can bounce back and forth on the same path, meaning that you don't have to complete a "circle" if your train goes between two points.

And don't forget that you can build transport rides underground! Your park can totally have a subway-monorail if depth permits.
