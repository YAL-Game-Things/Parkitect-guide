Per-ride notes

## Enterprise and co
Parkitect has a whole range of rides that can spin the guests until their lunch falls out. A coaster can easily match the intensity while having much lower Nausea rating, and you won't have to hire a janitor specifically to clean up countless puddles of vomit next to the ride exits.

## Drop Towers
Second smallest rides after the Motion Simulator, duration and intensity of these can be adjusted by changing their height.

## Twister
Notable for being 1.5 tiles tall, meaning that you can easily build other things on top of it.

## Go-Karts
It can be hard to tell what you're doing with Go-Karts since the game can't figure out the actual excitement rating until you let in the visitors *and* you can't test them with dummies.

But don't worry - so long as it's well-decorated, at least 70-80 seconds long (if it's not, increase lap count), and fits 12+ guests, you'll get 60+ excitement out of it.

And if you'd like an exciting track, build a racing kind of track -
4 laps, 10-15s per lap, 1 drop, and 1 tunnel per lap ([further reading](Go-Karts.md)).
