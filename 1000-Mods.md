You can also find a number of mods on both Workshop and mod.io.

Thanks to Steam's rather-lean rules on submissions, mods in Parkitect can do a variety of things - from adding new decorations and rides to changing fundamental game mechanics through memory patching.

If you'd like slightly more control over placing objects without getting into custom decorations, you might be interested in the following:
- **Transform Anarchy**
	([Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2997237650)
	· [mod·io](https://mod.io/g/parkitect/m/transform-anarchy))  
	If you've used 3d software before, you'll like this one - this mod adds a position-rotation gizmo when placing objects, allowing for fine placement and duplicating/tweaking existing objects through the Pipette tool.
- **Rotation Anarchy**
	([Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2859808704)
	· [mod·io](https://mod.io/g/parkitect/m/rotation-anarchy))  
	Adds ability to rotate objects on all 3 axes and in specified steps.  
	Technically superseded by Transform Anarchy, but I still use it to place objects with specific rotations.
- **Construction Anarchy**
	([Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1358845591)
	 · [mod·io](https://mod.io/g/parkitect/m/construction-anarchy1))  
	Lets you override grid sizes and place usually-grid-aligned decorations wherever you want.  
	Can be a little janky when enabling/disabling it mid-game.

If you've ever wished to see your park in first-person view, there are a couple mods for that:
- **CoasterCam**
	([Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1301723848)
	 · [mod·io](https://mod.io/g/parkitect/m/coastercam1))  
	Lets you see your rides from a guest's perspective.
- **PeepCam**
	([Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1666197015)
	· [GitHub](https://github.com/TheMasterCado/ParkitectPeepCam))  
	Lets you walk around your park and see how it looks from the ground level.
