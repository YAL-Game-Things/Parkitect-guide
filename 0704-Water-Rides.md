## Log Flume
You might not think much of the silly log ride, but it's cheap and easy to get exciting (all you need is some turns and a drop or two), making it a good choice for the campaign, and a great low-intensity ride in general.

## Calm River Ride
As a scenic ride, it can do sharp turns, but it can also do little drops, which allows for some interesting designs.

## River Rapids
A more intense version of the river ride with some fun track pieces.

## Bumper Boats
Fun, cute, and pleasantly inefficient at generating any sort of revenue.

A great attraction for a mildly successful park with enough place for a swimming pool.

## Paddleboats
If you only have Paddleboats and not Bumper Boats, don't worry - guests treat these like Bumper Boats anyway, ramming into obstacles or each other. Honestly, pretty accurate.
