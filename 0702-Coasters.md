## Mini Coaster
Featured earlier in this guide, the Mini Coaster is a good, cheap low-intensity ride.

## Junior Coaster
Slightly more capable and expensive than a Mini Coaster, this one can be pushed to intensity of 50 or so.

## Powered Coaster
Fairly unique in that it has lap count, which allows for some elegant designs.

## Steel Coaster and co
Cool-looking and generally expensive to build.

In campaign, the game will periodically tempt you with these in missions where there's not enough starting money to build both a Cool Coaster and the rest of the park.

## Wild Mouse
Thanks to its ability to do sharp sloped turns, a Wild Mouse can possess *any* intensity rating - all while being not too nauseating *and* being much cheaper than big coasters that it can imitate.

We have occasionally built Wild Mice styled after one or other Big Coaster while giving these matching colors and names like "Steel Impcoaster". Good fun.

## Bobsled Coaster
As once finely coined by someone, make sure to always do a test run of your coaster with dummies, lest your Bobsled Coaster becomes a Bobslay Coaster.
